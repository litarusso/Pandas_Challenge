# OVERVIEW OF PROJECT
This analysis was good for me to understand the effectiveness of Maria's new data. In addition, this project helped me to understand the structure of Pandas and to be able to analyze big data.

## Deliverable 1
### Collecting Data
At this deliverable, I collected the data, I created the path and imported the last data of Maria.

## Deliverable 2
### Cleaning The Data
This Data was big and unclean. So at the beginning, I had to clean it. You can find below what I have done
Found some duplicated values and null values. First, I cleaned those values and rows.
I got rid of column Grade's 'th' to see a clean table.

## Deliverable 3
### Summarizing The Data
When I summarized the data, I found that Dixon High Schools students' grades were low.

Found the average of math values to understand the effectiveness of math education,
Displayed a summary of the statistics,
Found minimum reading score
Summarized reading scores of Dixon High School. I did that,
Found the summary statistics of "grade 9."
Dixon High School reading scores,
Min math score of all data,
The student with the minimum reading score.

## Deliverable 4
### Drill Down into the data
In this deliverable, I see that grade nine student's math and reading grades are not significantly different (69.23, 66.58). Similarly, Grade 10 and 12 students' reading grades are very similar as well (63.25).

Displayed the grade column.
Display the first three rows and columns 3, 4, and 5.
Showed the rows for grade 9
Stored the row with the minimum overall reading score
Found the reading scores for the school and grade
Found the average reading score for all students in grades 11 and 12.

## Deliverable 5
### Comparing District vs Charter schools
In deliverable 5, I noticed that Public Schools' budget is higher than Charter Schools', but Charter Schools reading and Math scores are better than Public Schools'. Montgomery High School has the most student with 2038, and Chang High School has the minor student with 171.

Analyzed the average reading and math scores per school type,
Found the total number of students at each school and the average budget per grade for each school type.
